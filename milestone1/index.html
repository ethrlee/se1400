    <h2>Website Summary</h2>
        <h4>What content will this site contain?</h4>
            <p>This website will contain information about my personal collection of guitars, amps, and
            effects. It will also have the settings for each piece of gear given a specific song or
            artist i want to emulate.<p>
        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
            </p>I will be using my own personal collection of gear to take pictures and write the text
            for the site. I will also be using youtube videos and other guitar related websites.<p>
        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
            <p>Users should care about the focus of the site because it will give them a good idea of
            what gear they need to get a specific sound. It will also give them a good idea of what
            gear is out there and what it can do.<p>
        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
            <p>This site should be built mainly for my own record of how to achieve the sounds
                that i like. It will also be a good resource for other guitar players who are looking
                to achieve similar sounds.<p>
        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
            <p>I would like users to explore the site and find new gear that they might be interested
            in. I would also like them to try out the settings that i have provided and see if they
            can achieve the same sound.<p>
        <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
            <p>The goal of the site is to provide a resource for guitar players who are looking to
            achieve specific sounds. It will also be a good record for myself of how to achieve
            those sounds.<p>
